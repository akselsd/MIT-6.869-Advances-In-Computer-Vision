For this homework, the PSET is all contained in the notebook (PSet2_6869.ipynb) file, please run the local Jupyter notebook to open it (do not use colab)

This is a link that shows how to open jupyter-notebook: https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html

we will need the following python packages: numpy, scipy, cv2 (OpenCV) and matplotlib for PSet 2. 

The easiest way to install the package is to use Anaconda python. Anaconda comes with numpy ,scipy and matplotlib, so you don't need to install them by yourself. 
Anaconda also installs jupyter-notebook by default. But you need to install cv2 manually. 

The following are the installing instructions of Anaconda and OpenCV for windows, Mac and Ubuntu systems. 


####  Windows  ####
Follow the steps in this link to install Anaconda: 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/ 

After that, open Anacona Prompt and type "conda install -c conda-forge opencv" to install OpenCV. use "import cv2" to check whether your installation is successful. 


#### Mac  ####
Follow the steps in this link to install Anaconda: 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/

After that, open a terminal and type "conda install -c conda-forge opencv" to install OpenCV. use "import cv2" to check whether your installation is successful. 


#### Ubuntu ####
Follow the steps in this link to install Anaconda: 
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/

After that, open a terminal and type "conda install -c conda-forge opencv" to install OpenCV. use "import cv2" to check whether your installation is successful.
